 1. Copy your keys into the keys.txt file (the file/ email into the keys_to_read folder)
 2. Download and install Python 3.9. On Windows, download the installer from the official website and check the option during setup to add it to your PATH. On macOS, install Homebrew and then run 'brew install python'.
 3. If you're on Windows or Linux, install Git (pre-installed on macOS).
 4. Download the script from the command line (macOS: Terminal; Windows: Command Prompt/PowerShell) by running 'git clone https://github.com/sesutton/steamkey-redeem.git'.
 5. Navigate to the newly-created directory ('cd steamkey-redeem/') and install the required Python libraries by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. On Windows, you have to use 'python -m pip install -r requirements.txt' instead.
 6. Enter 'python steamkey-redeem.py' in the command line or double-click the script of the same name.
 7. All keys in the file should be displayed
 8. Login with your Steam account. You should receive an email with a code. Enter the code. **Check your Junk Folder!**
 9. All your keys should be redeemed. Steam limits how many can be redeemed at a time. If the program pauses, either leave it running, or rerun it another time after removing already redeemed keys.
